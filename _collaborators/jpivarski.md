### Biography

Jim Pivarski has been an experimental physicist, a Big Data consultant in industry, a software developer for data analysis tools, and a software project manager.

He received a Ph.D. in Experimental Particle Physics from Cornell University, where he analyzed data from the [CLEO experiment]([url](https://www.classe.cornell.edu/Research/CLEO/)), followed by the [Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)](https://cms.cern) experiment at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider) at [CERN](http://home.web.cern.ch/).

Starting in 2011, Jim was a consultant at [Open Data Group](https://www.opendatagroup.com/) (now ModelOp). There, he analyzed a wide variety of datasets using industry-standard tools and created [Portable Format for Analytics (PFA)](https://dmg.org/pfa/), an open standard for exchanging data mining models, now maintained by the [Data Mining Group](https://dmg.org/).

Since 2016, he has been developing the particle physics data analysis ecosystem as a Scientist at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) and a member of the [Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP)](http://iris-hep.org/). He is also a founding member of the [Scikit-HEP](https://scikit-hep.org/) software community, a convener of the [HSF](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) [PyHEP](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/pyhep.html) working group, and the author of [Uproot](https://uproot.readthedocs.io/) and [Awkward Array](https://awkward-array.org/). He now leads these two software projects as Principle Investigator of [OAC-2103945](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2103945).

### Project interests

Jim is interested in building coherency in data-oriented communities by developing interoperating tools, lines of communication, and shared understandings of how to work together. On the technical side, he promotes software built around high-performance data representations with interactive interfaces, and on the social side, networks built around small-scoped projects that fit together through agreed-upon protocols.
