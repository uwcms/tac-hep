### Biography

David Lange is a research scientist in the Department of Physics at Princeton University. He earned a Ph.D. in Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and previously was a staff scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He has been a member of the CMS experiment at CERN since 2006, where his research has focused on application software, and distributed computing, infrastructures needed to carry out the data-intensive scientific program of CMS. His current focus is is on the R&D needed for upgrades of these systems required for the Exabyte-scale datasets expected from the high luminosity running phase of the LHC (HL-LHC). Lange is also an executive board member of the  Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP) project funded by the US NSF, which develops state-of-the-art software for the HL-LHC. He was previously the co-coordinator of the offline software and computing for the CMS experiment, and is currently responsible for modeling the computing resource needs of CMS in the near-term and longer-term future.

### Project interests

D. Lange has a broad range of interests and projects that are suitable for collaboration. These include:
