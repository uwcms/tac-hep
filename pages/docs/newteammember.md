#### How to add a new team member of TAC-HEP on the website

* Add a photo named `First-Last.jpg` or `.png` to the [assets/images/team folder](https://github.com/uwcms/tac-hep/tree/main/assets/images/team). It should be 320x240 pixels.
* Add a "`<your github username>.yml`" file to the [people folder in the website repository](https://github.com/uwcms/tac-hep/tree/main/_data/people). Here is an example:

```yml
active: true
focus-area:
- <primary focus area(s), a list>
institution: <Your University>
name: <Your name>
photo: /assets/images/team/<First name>-<Last name>.jpg
shortname: <Your GitHub user ID>
title: <Can be blank - will show a title under your picture>
website: <Optional, your website>
